-- 7) Bottom 5 Worst Sellers are Brie Carre (490 Burgers), Mediterranean (934 Burgers), Calabrese (937 Burgers), Spinach Supreme (950 Burgers) and Soppressata (961).


CONCLUSION:
The outlet should capitalize on Large size Classic, Supreme, Veggie and Chicken Burgers.

Since XL and XXL Burgers account for such a small percentage of their sales (just 1.94%), they can safely get rid of these Burger sizes.

Even though the Brie Carre Burger is the worst seller, it recorded 490 Burgers sold. It would still be a good idea to keep it in the menu.
